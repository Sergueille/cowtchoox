Additional things to do (other ars scattered in the source file):

TODO: Create a module for emitting log, warnings, and errors. Maybe print them all in a nice and sorted way at the end (it's becoming urgent!)
TODO: create a struct that indicates a position in a file (absolute position, line number, filename, etc) and pass it everywhere (in node structs, in logs...)
TODO: parse math (maybe at the same time as the base parser, to easily support tags in maths)
